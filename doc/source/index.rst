Welcome to VAST's documentation!
================================

The **Void Analysis Software Toolkit**, or VAST, provides Python implementations 
of two popular classes of void-finding algorithms in galaxy catalogs:

1. Void identification by growing spherical voids.
2. Void identification using watershed algorithms.
  

Voids are expansive regions in the universe containing significantly fewer 
galaxies than surrounding galaxy clusters and filaments.  They are a fundamental 
feature of the cosmic web and provide important information about galaxy physics 
and cosmology.  For example, correlations between voids and luminous tracers of 
large-scale structure improve constraints on the expansion of the universe as 
compared to using tracers alone.  However, what constitutes a void is vague and 
formulating a concrete definition to use in a void-finding algorithm is not 
trivial.  As a result, several different algorithms exist to identify these 
cosmic underdensities.  VAST provides Python 3 implementations of two such 
algorithms: **VoidFinder** and :raw-html:`<strong>V<sup>2</sup></strong>`.

**VAST** also contains an implementation called **VoidRender** which utilizes OpenGL to
create interactive 3D visualizations of the output of the void-finding algorithms
overlaid on top of the reference galaxy survey.  Each of the void-finding algorithms
in **VAST** provides its own visualization class.

Installation
============

Operating System Support & Requirements
---------------------------------------

Linux
^^^^^

**VoidFinder** is currently only fully supported on Linux, but may run on 
OSX and other Unix variants.

:raw-html:`<strong>V<sup>2</sup></strong>` is fully supported on Linux.

**VoidRender** is not expected to work well with the Wayland
graphical backend.  VoidRender works well on the older and more stable Xorg 
backend, on Intel, Nvidia, and AMD graphical drivers.  Note that for extreme
performance settings (very high numbers of voids or a ``SPHERE_TRIANGULARIZATION_DEPTH``
greater than 3), a discrete gpu from AMD or Nvidia is highly recommended for a smooth
visualization.

It may be helpful to install the following for **VoidRender** on Ubuntu::

    sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev


OSX
^^^

The authors have successfully run **VoidFinder** with full 
multi-processing power on Mac/OSX, but until Apple guarantees a POSIX- or Single 
Unix Specification-compliant ``fork()`` system call, full multi-processing 
**VoidFinder** cannot be guaranteed.  However, the single-process version of 
**VoidFinder** should always work on OSX to the best of our knowledge, and (as 
of March 2022), **VoidFinder** seems to be working correctly on OSX.

:raw-html:`<strong>V<sup>2</sup></strong>` runs on OSX.

**VoidRender** is expected to work on OSX using the Intel graphical drivers.


Windows
^^^^^^^

The authors have encountered difficulty compiling the **VAST** Cython code 
on the Windows platform, and more importantly the ``fork()`` system call is not 
supported by Windows.  Given its small popularity as a scientific computing 
platform, we have no plans (as of May 2022) to support Windows.  




Prerequisite Libraries
----------------------

**VoidFinder** uses Cython to speed up its operations, so when building from source
you will need a C compiler like gcc.

**VoidRender** requires OpenGL :math:`\geq` 1.2.




Building VAST
-------------------

**VAST** does not yet have any pre-built wheels or distribution packages, 
so clone the repository from https://github.com/DESI-UR/VAST.

**VAST** will install like a normal python package via the shell command::

    python setup.py install
    
It is important to remember that this will attempt to install 
`vast` into the ``site-packages`` directory of whatever python 
environment that you are using.  To check on this, you can type::

    which python
    
into a normal unix shell and it will give you a path like ``/usr/bin/python`` or 
``/opt/anaconda3/bin/python``, which lets you know which python binary your 
``python`` command actually points to.


Developing VoidFinder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are actively developing **VAST**, you can install the package via::

    python setup.py develop
    
which installs a symlink into your python environment's ``site-packages`` 
directory, and the symlink points back to wherever your local copy of the 
**VAST** directory is.

If you are developing **VAST** and need to rebuild the cython, from the 
``VAST`` directory run::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Occasionally, it can be helpful to know the following command::

    cython -a *.pyx
    
which can be run from within the directory where the .pyx files live 
(currently ``VAST/python/vast/voidfinder/``) to "manually" build the cython 
(.pyx) files.


Installing VAST without admin privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are working in an environment where you cannot install **VAST**, or 
you do not have permissions to install it into the python environment that you 
are using, add ``--user`` to your choice of build from above.  For example:: 

    python setup.py develop --user
