Are the voids filled by dwarf galaxies? Do cosmological models predict too many small dark matter haloes inside the voids? Can the problems of cosmological models on small scales be addressed by studying the abundance of dwarf galaxies inside voids? We find that voids in the distribution of 1012h−1 M⊙ haloes (expected galactic magnitudes ∼M*) are almost the same as the voids in 1011h−1 M⊙ haloes. Yet, much smaller haloes with masses 109h−1 M⊙ and circular velocities vcirc∼ 20 km s−1 readily fill the voids: there should be almost 1000 of these haloes in a 20 h−1 Mpc diameter void. A typical void of diameter 20 h−1 Mpc contains about 50 haloes with vcirc \\&gt; 50 km s−1. The haloes are arranged in a pattern, which looks like a miniature universe: it has the same structural elements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of the Universe. There are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersections of filaments. The only difference is that all masses are four orders of magnitude smaller. There is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes, which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void. Large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to void boundaries. The mass function of haloes in voids is different from the ‘normal’ mass function. It is much steeper for high masses, resulting in very few M33-type galaxies (vcirc≈ 100 km s−1). We present an analytical approximation for the mass function of haloes in voids.}",

The algorithm starts from terminal-edges (local longest-edges) in a Delaunay triangulation and builds the largest possible low density terminal-edge regions around them. A terminal-edge region can represent either an entire void or part of a void (subvoid). Using artificial data sets, the case of voids that are detected as several adjacent subvoids is analyzed and four subvoid joining criteria are proposed and evaluated. Since this work is inspired on searches of a more robust, effective and efficient algorithm to find 3D cosmological voids the evaluation of the joining criteria considers this context. However, the design of the algorithm permits its adaption to the requirements of any similar application."

We define voids as non-overlapping maximal spheres empty of haloes or galaxies with mass or luminosity above a given value. We search for voids in cosmological N-Body simulations to test the performance of our void finders. We obtain and analyse the void statistics for several volume-limited samples for the North Galactic Pole (NGP) and the South Galactic Pole (SGP) constructed from the 2dFGRS full data release. We find that the results obtained from the NGP and the SGP are statistically compatible. From the results of several statistical tests we conclude that voids are essentially uncorrelated, with at most a mild anticorrelation and that at the 99.5 per cent confidence level there is a dependence of the void number density on redshift. We develop a technique to correct the distortion caused by the fact that we use the redshift as the radial coordinate. We calibrate this technique with mock catalogues and find that the correction might be of some relevance to carry out accurate inferences from void statistics. We study the statistics of the galaxies inside nine nearby voids. We find that galaxies in voids are not randomly distributed: they form structures like filaments. We also obtain the galaxy number density profile in voids. This profile follow a similar but steeper trend to that followed by haloes in voids.}",

Because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxy surveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, this situation is very unfortunate. We here present the first systematic comparison study of 13 different void finders constructed using particles, haloes, and semi-analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of the Millennium simulation. This study includes many groups that have studied voids over the past decade. We show their results and discuss their differences and agreements. As it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agree very well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centre of our volume. Voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 per cent of the mean cosmic density. In addition, those void finders that allow for void galaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. For example, the overdensity of void galaxies brighter than mB=−20 is found to be smaller than about −0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.}",

For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones.In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the watershed void finder (WVF), is based upon the watershed transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise.This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low-noise and high-noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are successfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function.}",
