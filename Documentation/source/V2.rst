V\ :sup:`2`
===========

`vast.Vsquared` is a software package for finding voids based on the ZOBOV 
(ZOnes Bordering On Voidness) algorithm [@Neyrinck:2007], which grows voids from 
local minima in the density field.


**Voronoi tesselation**

V\ :sup:`2` first produces a Voronoi tessellation of the catalog of large-scale 
tracers, and the volumes of the Voronoi cells are used to identify local density 
minima.

**Zones**

Zones are then built from density minima in the distribution of the Voronoi 
cells using a watershed transform, where each cell is linked to its least dense 
neighbor.

**Defining the voids**

Finally, voids are formed from these by identifying low-density boundaries 
between adjacent zones and using them to grow unions of weakly divided zones.  
This list of voids is then typically pruned to remove void candidates unlikely 
to be true voids.  `Vsquared` includes several of the different void-pruning 
methods that exist, including methods from other ZOBOV implementations such as 
VIDE [@VIDE:2012] and REVOLVER [@REVOLVER:2018].
