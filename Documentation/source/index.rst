Welcome to VAST's documentation!
================================

The **Void Analysis Software Toolkit**, or VAST, provides pure Python 
implementations of two popular classes of void-finding algorithms in galaxy 
catalogs:
1. Void identification by growing spherical voids.
2. Void identification using watershed algorithms.

Voids are expansive regions in the universe containing significantly fewer 
galaxies than surrounding galaxy clusters and filaments.  They are a fundamental 
feature of the cosmic web and provide important information about galaxy physics 
and cosmology.  For example, correlations between voids and luminous tracers of 
large-scale structure improve constraints on the expansion of the universe as 
compared to using tracers alone.  However, what constitutes a void is vague and 
formulating a concrete definition to use in a void-finding algorithm is not 
trivial.  As a result, several different algorithms exist to identify these 
cosmic underdensities.  The Void Analysis Software Toolkit, or VAST, provides 
Python 3 implementations of two such algorithms: **VoidFinder** and 
**V\ :sup:`2`**.
