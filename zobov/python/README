#Cosmological paramaters can be modified at the top of util.py, voidfinding parameters and input/output files at the top of zobov.py. To find voids and save void and zone information, run (in the zobov directory):

from zobov import Zobov
newZobov = Zobov(0,3) #if intermediate steps were saved (the default), run Zobov(4,4) instead
newZobov.sortVoids()
newZobov.saveVoids()
newZobov.saveZones()
